Once the Gateway has extracted the card details then it can use it with 3-D Secure and Fraud checking services as normal.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fpandpan-tokens">FPAN/DPAN tokens<a class="hash-link" href="#fpandpan-tokens" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Apple Pay and Google Pay (Mobile) payment tokens contain an EMV tokenised card number also known as a device-specific number (DPAN) rather than the Cardholder’s actual card
number (FPAN). With these tokens the expiry date is the date the DPAN expires rather than the value printed on the Cardholder’s card. The card mask returned by the Gateway will be the
masked DPAN, the Gateway is not able to return the last 4 digits of the FPAN. The card issuing details returned are the same as those of the original FPAN. Google Pay (Web) payment tokens contain the Cardholder’s original card number (FPAN) and expiry date. This means that the card mask and expiry date will be those of the original card.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="avscv2-checking">AVS/CV2 Checking<a class="hash-link" href="#avscv2-checking" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Digital wallet payment tokens do not contain any address or CVV details. The Cardholder’s billing address can be passed in the transaction along with the payment token so that address checking can be performed. The Gateway and Acquirer will not perform CVV checks with these payment tokens effectively disabling CVV checks for the transaction disregarding your preferences.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-d-secure-authentication">3-D Secure Authentication<a class="hash-link" href="#3-d-secure-authentication" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>DPAN based tokens will usually contain 3-D Secure data and so the Gateway will send this data to the Acquirer to gain the benefits of an authenticated transaction without the need to challenge the Cardholder. This makes using the digital wallet a much simpler and frictionless method of payment.
FPAN based tokens can be passed to the Gateway’s 3-D Secure processing and undergo the normal authentication journey as a manually entered card number.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="risk-checking">Risk Checking<a class="hash-link" href="#risk-checking" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Both FPAN and DPAN based tokens can be used with risk checking via Kount in the same manner as a normal card transaction.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transaction-lifecycle-and-recurring-transactions">Transaction Lifecycle and Recurring Transactions<a class="hash-link" href="#transaction-lifecycle-and-recurring-transactions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Both FPAN and DPAN based tokens will follow the standard transaction lifecycle and can be cancelled, captured, refunded or used as the basis of subsequent transactions in the same
manner as a normal card transaction.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ppro-transactions-apms">PPRO Transactions (APMs)<a class="hash-link" href="#ppro-transactions-apms" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>PPRO is an additional payment method that is available to all Merchants using the Gateway that have a PPRO account.</p><p>To use PPRO you will be supplied with a separate PPRO Merchant account that can be grouped with your main Merchant Account using the account mapping facility as documented in the <a href="/hostedpaymentfields/annexes#merchantAccountMapping">merchant account mapping</a> section. This allows transactions to be sent using your main Merchant Account and then routed automatically to the PPRO Merchant Account in the same mapping group.</p><p>PPRO is an Acquirer that offers many Alternative Payment Methods (APM), that you can then offer to your Customers.</p><p>E-wallets, SMS payments and PSP services are some of the many payment methods PPRO support (eg Alipay, EasyPay, Bancontact).

It is a secure e-commerce payment solution designed to allow you to accept China UnionPay debit cards via the Planet Acquirer, with a reduced the risk of fraudulent transactions while providing a friction-free payment process for your Customers. SecurePlus divides the online payment process into separate
authentication and authorisation transaction flows that authenticates the cardholder’s identity before you submit the authorisation request.</p><p>To use SecurePlus you will be supplied with a separate Planet Merchant Account that can be grouped with your main Merchant Account using the account mapping facility as documented in the <a href="/hostedpaymentfields/annexes#merchantAccountMapping">merchant account mapping</a> section. This allows transactions to be sent using your main Merchant Account and then routed automatically to the Planet Merchant Account in the same mapping group.</p><p>When UnionPay debit cards are issued, the Cardholder must register their mobile number with the Issuer. The SMS code authentication works at the time of checkout by submitting the payment details to UnionPay together with the Cardholder’s mobile number. The Issuer verifies the card and registered mobile number and sends an SMS message to the Cardholder’s mobile phone containing a unique 6-digit code. The Cardholder then enters this code into an authentication dialog provided by the Gateway so that it can be sent to UnionPay for verification.
If approved, the final financial transaction is submitted.</p><p>The authentication process is only required for debit cards. To accommodate the use of cards stored in secure online wallet, the card authentication has some built-in flexibility when other
compensating controls are employed.</p><p>SecurePlus transactions will appear in the Merchant Management System (MMS) alongside any card payments and can be captured, cancelled and refunded in the same way as card payments.</p><p>SecurePlus transactions can also be used for recurring billing with the SMS authentication not been required on recurring transactions as long as the initial transaction was successfully SMS authenticated.</p><p>For more information on how to accept SecurePlus transactions, please contact customer support.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>SecurePlus transactions are only available with a Planet Merchant Account.</p></div></div><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="benefits-5">Benefits<a class="hash-link" href="#benefits-5" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li>Authorisations are available immediately and returned as part of the transaction.</li><li>Provides your customers the flexibility of paying using their UnionPay debit card when this is more suitable to them than using other payment methods.</li><li>Can be implemented with little or no extra integration work if you already support 3-D Secure transactions.</li><li>There are no extra Gateway costs to use SecurePlus.
