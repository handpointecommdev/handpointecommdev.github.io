SecurePlus divides the online payment process into separate
authentication and authorisation transaction flows that authenticates the cardholder’s identity before you submit the authorisation request.</p><p>To use SecurePlus you will be supplied with a separate Planet Merchant Account that can be grouped with your main Merchant Account using the account mapping facility as documented in the <a href="/docs/annexes#merchantAccountMapping">merchant account mapping</a> section. This allows transactions to be sent using your main Merchant Account and then routed automatically to the Planet Merchant Account in the same mapping group.</p><p>When UnionPay debit cards are issued, the Cardholder must register their mobile number with the Issuer. The SMS code authentication works at the time of checkout by submitting the payment details to UnionPay together with the Cardholder’s mobile number. The Issuer verifies the card and registered mobile number and sends an SMS message to the Cardholder’s mobile phone containing a unique 6-digit code. The Cardholder then enters this code into an authentication dialog provided by the Gateway so that it can be sent to UnionPay for verification.
If approved, the final financial transaction is submitted.</p><p>The authentication process is only required for debit cards. To accommodate the use of cards stored in secure online wallet, the card authentication has some built-in flexibility when other
compensating controls are employed.</p><p>SecurePlus transactions will appear in the Merchant Management System (MMS) alongside any card payments and can be captured, cancelled and refunded in the same way as card payments.</p><p>SecurePlus transactions can also be used for recurring billing with the SMS authentication not been required on recurring transactions as long as the initial transaction was successfully SMS authenticated.</p><p>For more information on how to accept SecurePlus transactions, please contact customer support.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>SecurePlus transactions are only available with a Planet Merchant Account.</p></div></div><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="benefits-4">Benefits<a class="hash-link" href="#benefits-4" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li>Authorisations are available immediately and returned as part of the transaction.</li><li>Provides your customers the flexibility of paying using their UnionPay debit card when this is more suitable to them than using other payment methods.</li><li>Can be implemented with little or no extra integration work if you already support 3-D Secure transactions.</li><li>There are no extra Gateway costs to use SecurePlus.
